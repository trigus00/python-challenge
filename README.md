### -- Project Status : Completed 

## Project Intro/Objective 

It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. Welcome to the world of programming with Python. In this homework assignment, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete 2 Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.
Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situation where your newfound Python scripting skills can come in handy. These challenges are far from easy so expect some hard work ahead!

### Methods Used 
* Data Visualization
* Data Gathering 
* Data Cleaning
* Statistical Ananlysis 

### Technologies Used 
* Pandas
* Python 

## Project Description 
### pyber 
 In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period



## Needs of this project
- data exploration
- data processing/cleaning
